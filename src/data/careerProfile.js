  '<p>I am a researcher studying app migration and Blockchain. In detail, "app migration" is a technique that saves the program state of the program during its execution to generate a snapshot file, and transfers it to another device to restore the saved state to continue the execution. I am more focusing on Blockchain these days to design and make a Blockchain core that enables fast payment for micropayments. And also other application techniques like applying Blockchain to Mobile Edge Computing system to solve the problems which are incentive and integrity of the edge devices. If you want more details, my published papers will help.</p>'
