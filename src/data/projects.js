We think, however, the best usage of Blockchain is a paymnet system. Therefore, we have been designing and developing a new blockchain for fast payment.',

          description: 'A map application specialized for Seoul National University. Because SNU was very big and there was no map service that had all information of the university. So we developed SNUMAP, the first map application of Seoul National University. It was a project to learn how to design and develop server-client web service, and almost all the collaborators do not major in Computer Science. We had learned a lot of things, and students in the university were enjoyed our service. However, the school made its own map application with Daum Kakao, so that we quit our service. Because it did not have a business model.',
